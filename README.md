## Synopsis
Land valuation is crucial in the real estate industry and influences decision-making, property taxation, and urban development. Location quality, topography, climate, and water supply affect land value. In the Philippines, the Municipal Assessors Office (MAO) computes land value and tax based on the Manual on Real Property Appraisal and Assessment Operations (MRPAAO). However, the Schedule of Market Values needs updating every three years for accuracy, which often not implemented, leading to unreliable property valuations and fiscal challenges. 

## Objectives
This study generally aims to develop a Land Tax and Land Mapping Information System with Decision-rule-based Land Classification.
* Develop a system that calculates the land value and land tax based on various land factors.
* Generate analysis that determines the land valuation using the decision-rule model based on the land classification and enable the approximation representation of the future market value.
* Develop a web-based system integrating maps using OpenStreetMap for tax mapping. 
* Evaluate the system based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2011

## Motivation
The research aimed to enhance the visualization of tax changes to assist landowners in staying informed about their land value records and land zone images. Furthermore, the administrators were provided with a flexible method for calculating property values, allowing for customized unit values for each subclass under various land uses and factors available in each barangay. Even though the assessors in Pototan had only just begun incorporating emerging technology into their administrative processes, this information was developed to grant landowners access to their land information without requiring them to visit the office. This system also aids in securing records by eliminating the necessity for paper-based documents.
